# Enefit---Predict-Energy-Behavior-of-Prosumers

The Enefit competition calls upon participants to predict the energy behavior of prosumers in Estonia, individuals or businesses equipped with solar panels. The challenge involves forecasting electricity consumption or production by considering various factors such as weather data, energy prices, and installed photovoltaic capacity. Participants are required to employ time series forecasting techniques to predict the amount of electricity generated or consumed by prosumers across different segments and regions. The primary objective is to minimize imbalance costs in the energy grid.
