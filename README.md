# Enefit---Predict-Energy-Behavior-of-Prosumers

The Enefit competition calls upon participants to predict the energy behavior of prosumers in Estonia, individuals or businesses equipped with solar panels. The challenge involves forecasting electricity consumption or production by considering various factors such as weather data, energy prices, and installed photovoltaic capacity. Participants are required to employ time series forecasting techniques to predict the amount of electricity generated or consumed by prosumers across different segments and regions. The primary objective is to minimize imbalance costs in the energy grid.

The scatter plot visualizes the relationship between true (actual) and predicted values for various models, including linear, tree, forest, boosting, and the ensemble (Voting Regressor). Each point on the plot corresponds to a specific data instance, with the x-axis representing the true values and the y-axis depicting the corresponding predicted values. Ideally, all points would lie along the perfect prediction line, but deviations from this line indicate the extent of prediction errors. The plot allows for a comparison of how well each model and the ensemble capture the true values, providing insights into their performance across a range of scenarios.
